								<h2>About</h2>
								<p>"The best way to predict the future is to create it."

							</header>
							<p>I best describe myself as an <i>inquisitive doer</i> because it's a passion of mine to learn new or develop existing skills in my spare time.
							My objective is to adequately know the fundamentals and apply real life skills in various areas whether it's cooking cultured dishes, doing home repairment,
							or learning accounting principles. I'm a goal-oriented individual who feels happy and fulfilled when my goals are sufficiently met.
							As I continuously challenge myself, I aspire to evolve and become a better version than who I am today.</p>

								<h2>Unchainable Change</h2>
							</header>

								<p>Heart set like a stone, <br>
									Body solidified with a stubborn bone <br><br>
									I thought I was strong, <br>
									But experience proved me wrong <br><br>
									Will I ever break free, <br>
									Or long for the cessation of chains swathed around me? <br><br>
									I never knew what was coming, <br>
									but it was you whom I was longing <br> <br>
									Your smile lit up my times of darkness, <br>
									And your tears showered my heart with tenderness <br><br>
									
									In many ways, a lot has changed<br>
									Free from my past, I was no longer chained<br><br>
									
									It only had to be your presence<br>
									That gave my life an essence<br><br>
									
									For your love bestowed upon me,<br>
									Led me to contort my unbendable knee<br><br>
									
									On the ground, kneeling with my head up to meet your eyes<br>
									Where humility and compassion were in sights<br><br>
									
									Two words that had set me anew<br>
									Were from the three words spoken by you<br><br>
									
									“I. Love. You.”

								<h2>Wonder</h2>
							</header>

								<p>Right time, right person - what is my fate?<br>
									Will it all fall into my plate?<br><br>
									
									Was our stars aligned?<br>
									Or were they not at all connected?<br><br>
									
									Muttered up in one breath,<br>
									In which it sounded like a dreadful death<br><br>
									
									"In other world, we would be together"<br>
									You said it so lightly like a feather<br><br>
									
									Since when did it get so cold?<br>
									Knowing that your hands are not mine to hold<br><br>
									
									How could a love that was once so deep<br>
									could have fallen into a sudden steep?<br><br>
									
									A heavy rain-thundered thoughts came flooding in, I wonder...<br>
									Aimlessly grasping into the solidarity of peace, I wonder...<br><br>
									
									The wonder has given me an epiphany<br>
									Where a composition of distraught has turned into a wonderful symphony<br><br>
									
									It's not about the outcome of fate<br>
									It's the memories you choose to create<br><br>
									
									Because fate is not a chance<br>
									But a choice taken by a glance

								<h2>A Sprinkle of Fondness</h2>
							</header>

								<p>It was a sultry, summer day <br>
									As waters from a dual seven-story slide start to sway <br><br>

									Perhaps, you may not recall <br>
									This is a story where I began to fall <br><br>

									I don't know how and I don't know why <br>
									But you have given me a taste of the sky <br><br>

									Ploughed my way through the azure clouds <br>
									A sweet sensation of your meandering gaze was endowed <br><br>

									One hundred twenty-one centimeters away <br>
									There, we stood waiting on the stairway <br><br>

									A rush of air tenderly swifted your hair <br>
									As your train of thoughts left you unaware <br><br>

									The sun shimmered so brightly on your strand <br>
									Without knowing, a piece of your hair was already on my hand <br><br>
									
									Now, we're only about thirty centimeters away <br>
									And in that moment, my eyes fixated your way <br><br>

									"Oh sorry, there was a piece of hair on your chest" <br>
									You smiled with gratitude and I felt like I was on a mountain's crest <br><br>

									Took a step back and I was stumped <br>
									But it was a matter of time that my heart confirmed it with a thump <br><br>

									Perhaps, I do know how and I do know why <br>
									Besides my absolute admiration of your being, your compelling eyes are something I could never defy <br><br>

									And thus, a sprinkle of fondness is where it all began...
