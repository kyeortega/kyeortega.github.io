			<h2>About</h2>
				<p>"The best way to predict the future is to create it."
				-Abraham Lincoln</p>
		</header>
	<b>Hey, I’m Kye! A part tech nerd, a part creative, and a full-time curious human.</b><br><br>
	<p> My background’s a bit of a mash-up (in the best way): I’ve earned a BS in Management Information Systems, an MS in IT Management, and an Executive MBA in Accounting.
		Because why stop at two degrees when you can collect the whole set? Just kidding. I’ve always been drawn to the intersection of business, tech, and solving real-world problems (bonus points if there’s a spreadsheet involved). <br><br>

		When I’m not deep in systems, strategy, or pretending Excel is my best friend, you’ll probably find me behind a camera. I love capturing moments through photography and videography, especially when it involves natural light, cool shadows, or my loved ones doing something weird and wonderful. <br><br>

		Outside of that, I dabble in pretty much everything: cooking, sewing, scrapbooking, jiu-jitsu (yes, I can throw a punch and hem a dress), and binge-reading books I said I’d “just sample.” I believe life’s better when you're always learning, failing forward, and laughing at yourself along the way. <br><br>

		If there’s one thing I’m always chasing, besides goals, it’s growth. I’m constantly working to become a better version of myself, even if it means trying 12 hobbies to keep one.

								<h2>Unchainable Change</h2>
							</header>

								<p>Heart set like a stone, <br>
									Body solidified with a stubborn bone <br><br>
									I thought I was strong, <br>
									But experience proved me wrong <br><br>
									Will I ever break free, <br>
									Or long for the cessation of chains swathed around me? <br><br>
									I never knew what was coming, <br>
									but it was you whom I was longing <br> <br>
									Your smile lit up my times of darkness, <br>
									And your tears showered my heart with tenderness <br><br>
									
									In many ways, a lot has changed<br>
									Free from my past, I was no longer chained<br><br>
									
									It only had to be your presence<br>
									That gave my life an essence<br><br>
									
									For your love bestowed upon me,<br>
									Led me to contort my unbendable knee<br><br>
									
									On the ground, kneeling with my head up to meet your eyes<br>
									Where humility and compassion were in sights<br><br>
									
									Two words that had set me anew<br>
									Were from the three words spoken by you<br><br>
									
									“I. Love. You.”

								<h2>Wonder</h2>
							</header>

								<p>Right time, right person - what is my fate?<br>
									Will it all fall into my plate?<br><br>
									
									Was our stars aligned?<br>
									Or were they not at all connected?<br><br>
									
									Muttered up in one breath,<br>
									In which it sounded like a dreadful death<br><br>
									
									"In other world, we would be together"<br>
									You said it so lightly like a feather<br><br>
									
									Since when did it get so cold?<br>
									Knowing that your hands are not mine to hold<br><br>
									
									How could a love that was once so deep<br>
									could have fallen into a sudden steep?<br><br>
									
									A heavy rain-thundered thoughts came flooding in, I wonder...<br>
									Aimlessly grasping into the solidarity of peace, I wonder...<br><br>
									
									The wonder has given me an epiphany<br>
									Where a composition of distraught has turned into a wonderful symphony<br><br>
									
									It's not about the outcome of fate<br>
									It's the memories you choose to create<br><br>
									
									Because fate is not a chance<br>
									But a choice taken by a glance

								<h2>A Sprinkle of Fondness</h2>
							</header>

								<p>It was a sultry, summer day <br>
									As waters from a dual seven-story slide start to sway <br><br>

									Perhaps, you may not recall <br>
									This is a story where I began to fall <br><br>

									I don't know how and I don't know why <br>
									But you have given me a taste of the sky <br><br>

									Ploughed my way through the azure clouds <br>
									A sweet sensation of your meandering gaze was endowed <br><br>

									One hundred twenty-one centimeters away <br>
									There, we stood waiting on the stairway <br><br>

									A rush of air tenderly swifted your hair <br>
									As your train of thoughts left you unaware <br><br>

									The sun shimmered so brightly on your strand <br>
									Without knowing, a piece of your hair was already on my hand <br><br>
									
									Now, we're only about thirty centimeters away <br>
									And in that moment, my eyes fixated your way <br><br>

									"Oh sorry, there was a piece of hair on your chest" <br>
									You smiled with gratitude and I felt like I was on a mountain's crest <br><br>

									Took a step back and I was stumped <br>
									But it was a matter of time that my heart confirmed it with a thump <br><br>

									Perhaps, I do know how and I do know why <br>
									Besides my absolute admiration of your being, your compelling eyes are something I could never defy <br><br>

									And thus, a sprinkle of fondness is where it all began...

								<h2>The Look of your Eyes</h2>
							</header>

								<p>Please vocalize your thoughts<br>
								    My heart feels uneasy, tying up in knots<br><br>

									Something doesn't feel right<br>
									Yet our day ended with a good night<br><br>

									How long have you been ruminating?<br>
									Since when were you hesitating?<br><br>

									To tell me that you love me<br>
                                    As you set yourself to flee<br><br>

                                    In every moment of our day,<br>
                                    You’re the destined person that I pray<br><br>

                                    Everything seem to be aligned perfectly<br>
                                    But the unexpected news were delivered with certainty<br><br>

                                    We parted our separate ways<br>
                                    And my heart stubbornly stays<br><br>

                                    Where did it go wrong?<br>
                                    Did you know the aftermath all along?<br><br>

                                    Because the moment your eyes met mine,<br>
                                    A hefty, buried feelings beneath your gaze was a tell-tale sign...<br><br>

                                    ...that your look indicated various emotions<br>
                                    Where love was now intertwined with sadness and confusion<br><br>
                                    
                                    My hands were yours to hold<br>
                                    And as you chose to battle alone, you've gone cold<br><br>
                                    
                                    I tried to pick up the shattered pieces of what was left behind<br>
                                    Only for me to wish that things could unwind<br><br>
                                    
                                    Thousands of questions pondered through my head<br>
                                    When there's nothing I could do but comprehend<br><br>
                                    
                                    But if ever our eyes meet once more,<br>
                                    I hope to see the underlying happiness I've always adore
