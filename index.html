								<h2>Unchainable Change</h2>
							</header>

								<p>Heart set like a stone, <br>
									Body solidified with a stubborn bone <br><br>
									I thought I was strong, <br>
									But experience proved me wrong <br><br>
									Will I ever break free, <br>
									Or long for the cessation of chains swathed around me? <br><br>
									I never knew what was coming, <br>
									but it was you whom I was longing <br> <br>
									Your smile lit up my times of darkness, <br>
									And your tears showered my heart with tenderness <br><br>
									
									In many ways, a lot has changed<br>
									Free from my past, I was no longer chained<br><br>
									
									It only had to be your presence<br>
									That gave my life an essence<br><br>
									
									For your love bestowed upon me,<br>
									Led me to contort my unbendable knee<br><br>
									
									On the ground, kneeling with my head up to meet your eyes<br>
									Where humility and compassion were in sights<br><br>
									
									Two words that had set me anew<br>
									Were from the three words spoken by you<br><br>
									
									“I. Love. You.”

								<h2>Wonder</h2>
							</header>

								<p>Right time, right person - what is my fate?<br>
									Will it all fall into my plate?<br><br>
									
									Was our stars aligned?<br>
									Or were they not at all connected?<br><br>
									
									Muttered up in one breath,<br>
									In which it sounded like a dreadful death<br><br>
									
									"In other world, we would be together"<br>
									You said it so lightly like a feather<br><br>
									
									Since when did it get so cold?<br>
									Knowing that your hands are not mine to hold<br><br>
									
									How could a love that was once so deep<br>
									could have fallen into a sudden steep?<br><br>
									
									A heavy rain-thundered thoughts came flooding in, I wonder...<br>
									Aimlessly grasping into the solidarity of peace, I wonder...<br><br>
									
									The wonder has given me an epiphany<br>
									Where a composition of distraught has turned into a wonderful symphony<br><br>
									
									It's not about the outcome of fate<br>
									It's the memories you choose to create<br><br>
									
									Because fate is not a chance<br>
									But a choice taken by a glance

								<h2>A Sprinkle of Fondness</h2>
							</header>

								<p>It was a sultry, summer day <br>
									As waters from a dual seven-story slide start to sway <br><br>

									Perhaps, you may not recall <br>
									This is a story where I began to fall <br><br>

									I don't know how and I don't know why <br>
									But you have given me a taste of the sky <br><br>

									Ploughed my way through the azure clouds <br>
									A sweet sensation of your meandering gaze was endowed <br><br>

									One hundred twenty-one centimeters away <br>
									There, we stood waiting on the stairway <br><br>

									A rush of air tenderly swifted your hair <br>
									As your train of thoughts left you unaware <br><br>

									The sun shimmered so brightly on your strand <br>
									Without knowing, a piece of your hair was already on my hand <br><br>
									
									Now, we're only about thirty centimeters away <br>
									And in that moment, my eyes fixated your way <br><br>

									"Oh sorry, there was a piece of hair on your chest" <br>
									You smiled with gratitude and I felt like I was on a mountain's crest <br><br>

									Took a step back and I was stumped <br>
									But it was a matter of time that my heart confirmed it with a thump <br><br>

									Perhaps, I do know how and I do know why <br>
									Besides my absolute admiration of your being, your compelling eyes are something I could never defy <br><br>

									And thus, a sprinkle of fondness is where it all began...

								<h2>The Look of your Eyes</h2>
							</header>

								<p>Please vocalize your thoughts<br>
								    My heart feels uneasy, tying up in knots<br><br>

									Something doesn't feel right<br>
									Yet our day ended with a good night<br><br>

									How long have you been ruminating?<br>
									Since when were you hesitating?<br><br>

									To tell me that you love me<br>
                                    As you set yourself to flee<br><br>

                                    In every moment of our day,<br>
                                    You’re the destined person that I pray<br><br>

                                    Everything seem to be aligned perfectly<br>
                                    But the unexpected news were delivered with certainty<br><br>

                                    We parted our separate ways<br>
                                    And my heart stubbornly stays<br><br>

                                    Where did it go wrong?<br>
                                    Did you know the aftermath all along?<br><br>

                                    Because the moment your eyes met mine,<br>
                                    A hefty, buried feelings beneath your gaze was a tell-tale sign...<br><br>

                                    ...that your look indicated various emotions<br>
                                    Where love was now intertwined with sadness and confusion<br><br>
                                    
                                    My hands were yours to hold<br>
                                    And as you chose to battle alone, you've gone cold<br><br>
                                    
                                    I tried to pick up the shattered pieces of what was left behind<br>
                                    Only for me to wish that things could unwind<br><br>
                                    
                                    Thousands of questions pondered through my head<br>
                                    When there's nothing I could do but comprehend<br><br>
                                    
                                    But if ever our eyes meet once more,<br>
                                    I hope to see the underlying happiness I've always adore
